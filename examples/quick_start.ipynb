Each sequence of actions produces a circuit, and together, the union of all possible assembly sequences forms a searchable decision tree.\n",

    "We need to also choose a way to represent each circuit uniquely with a string, called the `state` (or `state`). At minimum, the string should encode (i) which components are present, (ii) which interactions are present, and (iii) whether or not the assembly has terminated. It may also ensure that each unique circuit gets a unique string. For example, let's use the following representation:\n",
    "* Each component is an uppercase letter (`A` and `B`) \n",
    "* Each type of interaction is a lowercase letter (`a` and `i` for activation and inhibition, respectively)\n",
    "* Terminated (fully assembled) circuits begin with an asterisk `*`\n",
    "* Each interaction has a 3-character code. `ABi` can be read \"`A` inhibits `B`\"\n",
    "* Interactions are separated by an underscore `_`\n",
    "* Components are separated from interactions by colons `::`\n",
    "* Components and interactions are sorted in alphabetic order\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the state string `*AB::ABi_BAi` denotes a terminally assembled circuit with components `A` and `B` that inhibit each other (i.e. a toggle switch). Sorting the interactions ensures that assembly steps are associative and order doesn't matter (`ABi` then `BAi` yields the same string as `BAi` then `ABi`). Also note that this representation does not account for symmetry, so if we assemble two circuits that are identical but the labels `A` and `B` are switched, they will have different state strings.\n",
