While perfect parallel execution isn't possible, we can achieve quite good performance using the so-called lock-free method [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-12993-3_2), where multiple multiple search threads in the same CPU (the *main node*) are running MCTS concurrently, each one taking turns editing the search graph. We will implement this in detail later in the tutorial, but in brief, instead of computing the (usually expensive) reward function, each search thread on the main node sends a request to a group of worker CPUs (the *worker node*) somewhere else that will do the actual computation, and while that thread is waiting for the result, other search threads can use the main CPU. As long as our execution time is significantly longer than the time spent sending and receiving those signals, we should see a performance boost!\n",

This immediately returns an `AsyncResult` object that can be inspected to monitor progress. Then, once we need the result, we call `future.get()` and wait for the reward to arrive.

    "Python's `threading` module can manage up to a few dozen threads, but we want to run a search with hundreds to thousands of threads. For this, we will use the `gevent` module, which re-defines many of the built-in Python commands in order to support its highly scalable \"green threads.\" Re-defining built-in code is called \"monkey patching,\" and it has to be run as the first line in the file where we define the class. (We also ran `monkey.patch_all()` at the beginning of this notebook - this is only necessary for notebooks, not for scripts.)"
